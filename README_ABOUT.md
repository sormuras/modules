## About Java module names

[@jodastephen](https://github.com/jodastephen) writes about Java module naming:

> Java SE 9 brought a new feature, the Java Platform Module System (JPMS).
> Due to certain constraints in the design, it is important for there to be an agreed naming strategy across open source projects.
> My proposed strategy is detailed here [http://blog.joda.org/2017/04/java-se-9-jpms-module-naming.html](http://blog.joda.org/2017/04/java-se-9-jpms-module-naming.html).

> In summary, the strategy is:
>
> * Module names must be valid Java identifiers! E.g. no Java keywords, no dashes, no...
> * Module names must be reverse-DNS, just like package names, e.g. `org.joda.time`.
> * Modules are a group of packages. As such, the module name must be related to the package names.
> * Module names are strongly recommended to be the same as the name of the super-package.
> * Creating a module with a particular name takes ownership of that package name and everything beneath it.
> * As the owner of that namespace, any sub-packages may be grouped into sub-modules as desired so long as no package is in two modules.

This project applies that strategy to compile a _database_ of unique module names derived from artifacts published on Maven Central.

- :cd: is ["an automatic module"](http://branchandbound.net/blog/java/2017/12/automatic-module-name), i.e. it declares a stable module name via an `AUTOMATIC-MODULE-NAME` entry in its `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file.
- :dvd: denotes an explicit containing a compiled `module-info.class` module descriptor.


### Unique modules on Maven Central

* [module-maven.properties](module-maven.properties) - Module name to Maven `${group}:${artifact}` ID database
* [module-version.properties](module-version.properties) - Module name to current version database
* [modules.properties](modules.properties) - Module name to CSV source line database
 
The _database_ consists of `.properties` files that are generated by parsing publications made to Maven Central.
@sandermak's [modulescanner](https://github.com/sandermak/modulescanner) scans those publications and store module-related events in CSV files.

## `Modules.java`

This project contains the single-file source-code Java program ([JEP330](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330)): [`Modules.java`](src/Modules.java)

With `{path}` pointing to a directory containing all CSV files to parse, you may create the `.properties` files locally.

```text
java src/Modules.java {path}
```

### Reverse-DNS, with the exception of...

Initially, [maven-group-alias.properties](maven-group-alias.properties) is read to cherry-pick some non reverse-DNS aliases for well-known projects.

A Maven group ID with all dashes `-` removed is also considered a match.
For example, `org.f-oo-ba-r.b-az` is transformed to `org.foobar.baz` before checking the start of a module name.  

### Suspicious modules found on Maven Central

Modules listed in the **Suspicious Modules** section ([suspicious/](suspicious)) are suspicious and need manual correction.
If you find your module listed there, or know an author of one, please [create an issue](https://github.com/sormuras/modules/issues/new) for investigation.
